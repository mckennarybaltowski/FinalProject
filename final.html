    	    <p>In the late 1930s Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910–1994) became a leading 
    	    practitioner of the use of X-ray crystallography in determining the three-dimensional
    	    structure of complex organic molecules.</p>
    	    <p>At Somerville College, Oxford, she studied physics and chemistry and chose 
    	    to do her fourth-year research project on X-ray crystallography. She had to 
    	    crystallize the substance under study, shoot X-rays at the crystal, and then 
    	    study the way the X-rays were diffracted off the planes of the crystal’s structure.
    	    The technique, which involves a lot of mathematical analysis, was developed by 
    	    Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, who shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in 
    	    Physics for their work. Yet X-ray crystallography was still a relatively new 
    	    technology with many challenges—and hence opportunities for research—when 
    	    Hodgkin entered the field.</p>
    	    <p>After graduation she studied at Cambridge University with John Desmond Bernal, 
    	    who had worked for five years with the senior Bragg. She and Bernal collaborated 
    	    successfully, using X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional 
    	    structure of several complex organic molecules important to the functioning of 
    	    living organisms. In 1937 she received her PhD from Cambridge— the same year 
    	    she married Thomas L. Hodgkin, who became an authority on African history.</p>
